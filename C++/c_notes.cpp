// Zero Cost Abstractions
// What you don't use, you don't pay for/
// What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better.

//C++ allows us to define our own abstractions but it also comes with built-in abstractions.
//The range based for-loop makes it possible to iterate over a range of values (an array in JS).

// Exceptions
// A C++ exception is a response to an exceptional circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by zero.
// Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.
// Throw
// A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.
// Catch
// A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
// Try
// A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated. It's followed by one or more catch blocks.

//"::" operator
// the :: operator tells the compiler which class/namespace to look in for an identifier.
// std::cout tells the compiler you want the "cout" identifier and it is in the std namespace.
// std means standard library.
